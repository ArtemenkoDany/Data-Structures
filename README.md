# Data Structures

That repositorie included most famous data structures writed on Python.

To use that stuctures you do not need write them by yourself. The solution is in Using StructLinks package.

### Type the command in your command line:
```bash
pip install structlinks
```


## Linced list 

Linked list is a simple data structure in programming, which obviously is used to store data and retrieve it accordingly. To make it easier to imagine, it is more like a dynamic array in which data elements are linked via pointers (i.e. the present record points to its next record and the next one points to the record that comes after it, this goes on until the end of the structure) rather than being tightly packed.

To start with Python, it does not have a linked list library built into it like the classical programming languages. Python does have an inbuilt type list that works as a dynamic array but its operation shouldn’t be confused with a typical function of a linked list. This doesn’t mean one cannot implement a linked list in Python, they can but it will not be straight up.

## Avl trees (coming soon)
In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

## Splay trees (coming soon)
A splay tree is a binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. Like self-balancing binary search trees, a splay tree performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in O(log n) amortized time.
