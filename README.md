# Data Structures

That repositorie included most famous data structures writed on Python.

To use that stuctures you do not need write them by yourself. The solution is in Using StructLinks package.

### Type the command in your command line:
```bash
pip install structlinks
```


## Linced list

Linked list is a simple data structure in programming, which obviously is used to store data and retrieve it accordingly. To make it easier to imagine, it is more like a dynamic array in which data elements are linked via pointers (i.e. the present record points to its next record and the next one points to the record that comes after it, this goes on until the end of the structure) rather than being tightly packed.

To start with Python, it does not have a linked list library built into it like the classical programming languages. Python does have an inbuilt type list that works as a dynamic array but its operation shouldn’t be confused with a typical function of a linked list. This doesn’t mean one cannot implement a linked list in Python, they can but it will not be straight up.
